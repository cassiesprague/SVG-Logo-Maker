## Description
This application allows users to generate a SVG Logo with ease. Users will be prompt a short series about the shape, shape color, text, and text color they desire their logo to be. 

My motivation for this application was an easy way to generate logos fast and from the terminal. Creating a logo should be a quick and easy task, so building an app to help with this process will save time.
